## Before the Addition
I'm going to extend slogo so that stamps of turtles can be created and cleared. The code for this associated with my role in slogo is extremely easy; it only requires to add the commands to the resource file and create new commands that extend existing abstract classes. The other part of implementing this feature may require code that I had not worked with during the project. I think I would have to change two resource files, add two classes, change the turtle dictionary, and then modify two or three classes in the front end. My current idea is to create a static turtle as the stamp, which doesn't respond to any commands except for clearstamp. Since I'm working with code that I havent worked with before, I expect this addition to take in between 2 and 2.5 hours.

## After the Addition
It took around 2 hours to complete this feature, and I needed to update around 10 classes total. Three of which were resource files, two new classes, and then five other classes needed aded code to actually implement the feature. Since I never worked with displaying turtles and had no idea how the front end handled turtles, I had to spend some time starting a way to update the code, and after deciding it wouldn't work, I would delete it. However, when I came up with the idea currently implemented, I got it right the first time. 

This exercide reveals how easily extensible a project is and how easy/hard it is for those who did not write the code to understand and extend it. The overall design and documentation was as good as I had remembered, and it wasn't that difficult to find the classes and code to implement stamps. However, I do think that the way that turtles are displayed and updated is fairly confusing, and while the class method javadocs helped, it was still like a pick and search method to find where things were happening in the code. Had I not written the code at all, adding this feature would have been difficult, because knowledge of similar commands in the back-end allowed me to easily create these commands easily, and without this knowledge, it would have been confusing and there would have been a lot of trial/error.
