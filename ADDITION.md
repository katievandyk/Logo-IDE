## BEFORE
I worked on the front end for the Slogo project, but our group has already implemented the feature which allows users to see the images of all turtles. The active turtles are full color, while the inactive turtles are half opacity to show their state. Clicking on the images of the turtles toggles their state, and also selects them. This allows the user to change the image of only the selected turtle. 
Due to this, the feature which I will implement is the the only front end feature which my group did not implement. This is the ability to click to execute / edit past commands that were entered, from the stored history. 
I estimate that this will likely take me somewhere in the range of 1-2 hours. This is because I will need to locate the correct classes to deal with in the code, create an implementation that will succeed in adding the feature, and then optimize/refactor it to improve it. 
I believe this will not require any new files, but I may add an extra class if it makes the process cleaner. This feature should be able to be added by altering the methods which allow the user to interact with the text boxes containing the past commands. This does not sound too difficult, but I am unfamiliar with how to handle this type of javaFX visual string collection.
