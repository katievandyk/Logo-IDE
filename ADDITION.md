# SLogo Addition

## Before

### Time Estimate
I estimate it to take between 2-2.5 hours to implement the Frontend extension. I believe that it will take 1-1.5 hours to create the new Panel and test it, and then another 0.5-1 hours to refactor and document my changes. I estimate that the most time will be spent on creating the ScrollPane and also figuring out the best way to pass the new image information to the Turtle.  

### Files Changed
I’ll have to change the MainScreen class in order to incorporate the new panel into the BorderPane, as I plan on making the new panel a substitute for the left side of the ‘current state’ panel at the bottom of the screen, which currently displays state information for only one turtle. I will also have to create a 'Frontend Turtle' interface, so that I can encapsulate unnecessary Turtle information from my new panel. I plan to make my panel a ScrollPane that includes a button for each Turtle. The button itself will contain the image of the Turtle, and clicking it will cause the Turtle’s ID and image to show up to the right of the panel, along with an ImageChooser, to change the image of the Turtle.  This information will be passed, using the Frontend interface, to the Turtle class, where it will be updated and reflected on the Turtle Panel using its existing 'changeImage' method. I can use the existing image properties file to give the user image options. I’ll likely have to change the default.css file too, to make a custom button to hold the Turtle. 

## After
While adding my feature, I was more aware of flaws in my frontend code than I had initially remembered. The reason that so many classes were changed in my addition was because I had violated simple rules- like passing an ArrayList instead of a List. When I changed the Panel superclass to contain only Lists, I evidently had to change the other Panels to also reflect those changes. I was also not impressed with how many instance variables I had kept in my code before, and the "Smart" methods I had used to construct my STATE_PANEL containing all the turtle's information, by placing components at magic-number offsets. However, I was happy with my Panel hierarchy, as it allowed me to easily construct a Panel in a similar fashion to my other ones. My Button and Text factories that I had placed in the Panel superclass also came in handy for making the Turtle buttons.

I ended up creating one new Panel class (TurtleListPanel), and cutting down the StatePanel to fit it in. I modified the MainScreen class to contain my panel, which was relatively easy since all I had to do was create an instance of my Panel and add it to the corresponding VBox. I also created a FrontendTurtle interface to better encapsulate information from the backend. Encapsulation is definitely something that could have been imrpoved upon in my initial implementation. 

To someone who had never seen the code before, creating the feature would have been easy in the sense of making the Panel and adding components to it via the different Factory classes. It would have been more difficult for someone to add the Panel to the MainScreen class in the right place. Since I was so familiar with that aspect of the code, it came second nature to me. Overall, this exercise was a great way for me to tangibly see how far I've come as a coder from SLogo, as my code was evidently weaker than I remembered it to be. It was also a great way for me to reflect on how a third party would look at code I've written, which is a perspective I should keep in mind for future projects.
