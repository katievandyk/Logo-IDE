## Before the Addition
I'm going to extend slogo so that stamps of turtles can be created and cleared. The code for this associated with my role in slogo is extremely easy; it only requires to add the commands to the resource file and create new commands that extend existing abstract classes. The other part of implementing this feature may require code that I had not worked with during the project. I think I would have to change two resource files, add two classes, change the turtle dictionary, and then modify two or three classes in the front end. My current idea is to create a static turtle as the stamp, which doesn't respond to any commands except for clearstamp. Since I'm working with code that I havent worked with before, I expect this addition to take in between 2 and 2.5 hours.
